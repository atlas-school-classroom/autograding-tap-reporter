## Atlas School Autograding Reporter

This repository is a fork of [https://github.com/classroom-resources/autograding-grading-reporter](https://github.com/classroom-resources/autograding-grading-reporter)

## Overview

**Atlas School Autograding Reporter** is a plugin for GitHub Classroom's Autograder. Use it to report the results of the test execution to students and GitHub Classroom. It supports autodetecting standard file outputs for common testing frameworks.

## Supported Formats

### TAP (Test Anything Protocol)

[Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/) is a standard format that is supported by many libaries across common languages. The github action will scan for tap files in the workspace and parse the result into a report. Example TAP output:

To find a library that supports TAP output for a given language, checkout [TAP Producers](https://testanything.org/producers.html)

### TRX (Visual Studio Test Result)

TRX files are test result files that are created either by Microsoft Visual Studio or Microsoft MSTest. Visual Studio is a program used to develop Windows software, while MSTest is a command-line utility to run various unit tests for Visual Studio. The test results from these unit tests are saved in a TRX file and in the XML format. The TRX format is a format common in c#.

### JUnit

The JUnit XML format is a standardized structure for representing test execution results, widely used in continuous integration (CI) pipelines and testing frameworks. It is an XML-based schema that captures details about test cases, suites, and their outcomes, including success, failure, errors, or skipped statuses. This format is highly interoperable, enabling seamless integration with CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and reporting libraries for visualizing test results.

### Environment Variables

| Env Name               | Description                                     | Required | Default |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |

| GLOB_IGNORE | File pattern to ignore when locating result files | No      |  node_modules/**  |

### Usage

1. Add the GitHub Classroom Reporter to your workflow.

```yaml
name: Grading Report
on:
  - push
  - workflow_dispatch
permissions:
  checks: write
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  run-autograding-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Add steps to run tests
      - name: Grade Report
        if: always() # If your test command returns an error, add this to always run grade report
        uses: atlas-school-classroom/atlas-autograding-reporter@main
        env:
          MAX_POINTS: 50
```

## Output

### Console Output

The action will output the report directly to the console in the github action. It will also fail the action if there are any failing tests

### Development

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is used to manage dependencies. To install dependencies run:
```
pnpm install
```

The github action runs the `dist/index.js` file. To run code in a github action you must build the code and then commit the changes to the dist folder. To build the code run:

```
pnpm build
```

Once built you can push to gihub to run a sample worflow. There a workflow setup for testing the action. When pushing to the repository it will automatically run.

**IMPORTANT:** In order to not impact students do not push to the main branch for testing. All student assignments run off the main branch. Develop in a feature branch and then only push to main when code has been tested and is ready for student assignments.
